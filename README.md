Easy-to-use UltiSnips for Vim and Neovim
</b>
</p>

This repository contains the UltiSnip snippet files used during the writing
sessions for all the research papers, presentations, and software development
projects of [Gregory M. Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/). Please
note that all the snippets in this repository are "hard-coded" to work for my
development environment and projects. Even though they are heavily customized,
my hope is that they will give examples of different facets of writing snippets
in UltiSnips. For reference, some of the snippets are extracted from the blog
post [How I'm Able to Take Notes in Mathematics Lectures Using LaTeX and
Vim](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/).

## Problems or Praise

If you have any problems with using these snippets for UltiSnips, then please
raise an issue associated with this Git repository using the "Issues" link at
the top of this repository. As the sole contributor to this repository, I will
do everything possible to resolve your issue and ensure that all of the
snippets clear and, potentially, best suited to working in your development
environment. Remember, this repository is being made publicly available so as
to provide examples of how to write snippets for UltiSnips. If you find that
these files help you in preparing your own snippets, then I also encourage
you to "star" and "watch" this project!
